My name is Lars and I am a jack of all trades, but master of none.

I have been through about every programming language, became part of the cyber

finally arrived in the fascinating world of **mobile development** ðŸ˜›

I would love for you to join me on this ride - so let's advance together!

might revive them at some point. 
For now, there is my old blog featuring mostly [CTF](https://ctf101.org/) Writeups:
